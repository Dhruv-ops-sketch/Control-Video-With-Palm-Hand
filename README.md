# Control-Video-With-Palm-Hand
Uses Python to access camera feed to detect hand movements to play, pause, fast-forward, and play-back videos


Hello everyone! 

This program uses opencv, mediapipe, time, numpy, and pyautogui modules to use live camera feed to detect the position of your palm and wrist. 

#Instructions for control:
A significant movement of your palm (facing the camera) to either right or left results in the same effect in the video currently being watched on the screen (Online/Offline) i.e it fast-forwards or plays-back respectively.
To play/pause the video, you can show your fist to the camera.
